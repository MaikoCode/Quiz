To improve the user experience and maintain application state continuity, even after a page refresh, you can persist your Redux state using a variety of strategies:

Redux Persist:
This is a popular library for persisting and rehydrating the Redux store. It allows you to save your Redux state in localStorage or sessionStorage and restore it on app start. Here’s how you might set it up:

// store.js or wherever you create your Redux store
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { persistStore, persistReducer } from 'redux-persist';
import storage from 'redux-persist/lib/storage'; // defaults to localStorage for web
import rootReducer from './reducers'; // your reducers

const persistConfig = {
  key: 'root',
  storage,
};

const persistedReducer = persistReducer(persistConfig, rootReducer);

const store = createStore(persistedReducer);
const persistor = persistStore(store);

export { store, persistor };
And then in your root component:

import { PersistGate } from 'redux-persist/integration/react';
import { store, persistor } from './store'; // your store configuration

// In your component...
return (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <PersistGate loading={null} persistor={persistor}>
      <App />
    </PersistGate>
  </Provider>
);
Manual LocalStorage:
You can manually save certain parts of the Redux state to localStorage on each update and load it back when the app starts. This requires more manual management and is less recommended than using redux-persist.

URL State:
For some types of state, you can encode them into the URL as query parameters or route parameters. This is particularly useful for things like search filters or pagination.

Server-Side Storage:
If certain state needs to persist between sessions or across different devices, consider storing it on the server and retrieving it upon app startup via API calls.

IndexedDB:
For larger amounts of data or more complex storage needs, consider using IndexedDB with a library like localForage.

Error Handling:
Add proper error handling in case the local storage data is corrupted or not available, to ensure a graceful user experience.

Security Considerations:
Think carefully about what data you persist in the client-side storage. Sensitive data should not be stored in localStorage or sessionStorage due to security risks.

In essence, the goal is to automatically restore the state after a page refresh. Redux Persist is generally the easiest and most robust approach for most web applications. By using it, your app’s state will be transparently saved and reloaded, making the experience smoother for your users, even the "villainous" ones who refresh the page.
